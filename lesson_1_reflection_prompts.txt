How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The logic I followed was that , if the old one was working then
    I must check the changes in the new file and focus mostly on 
    those changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will give me an idea about when did a program start to
    have bugs/ any issues

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually

    Pros
    -You get to manage the number of versions you have of your work, and it makes it easier to 
    go through small versions as compared to going through a lot of versions not knowing which
    pne was addressing a certain fix

    Cons
    -As a human being , you could loose your work due to so many reasons and it could be a mission 
    to reproduce your work.

    Automatically

    Pros
    - You are certain that your work will always be saved regardless of what happens,
    either with your device , internet or any related tools used for your work.

    Cons
    -It might be hard to figure out what changes made sense or work, and the versions of your
    work might be overwhelming when you have to go through them

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is used mostly by developers therefore some files/programs to function they
    require related files and not only the file changed.

    Google Docs are used for compiling reports of some sort, therefore the context
    of the files matters more , i.e only one file will be used at the end.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First use git log to get all logs of the commits and then use commits' ids
    by using git diff previous id current id to check the difference between 
    previous and current commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You know you can always revert to the changes that worked before

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To upload my stuff to github, and use it to improve my productivity
