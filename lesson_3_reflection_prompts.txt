When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are collaborating, or you plan to acces the files from a different machine in the
    future.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    the remote might update your local repository while you were still working on 
    a particulat feauture or lines of code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - forks are repositories owned/created by someone, you want to use it when you 
    want to use their work to do whatever you want.

    - clones are copies of repositories, these copies can be forks initially.

    - branches are just working folders or directories you create when you want to
    work on another part of the project without 
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
